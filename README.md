# Basic-banking-system-TSF


Greetings! My name is Jayanth Onteru, and I am currently interning as a Web Development and Designing Intern at The Sparks Foundation. I was assigned Task 1, which is to create a simple dynamic website for a basic banking system that fulfills the following requirements.

- The flow of the website starts with a homepage that has links to view all customers and transaction history. Users can then view all customers, their account balance, and transfer money to another customer. Additionally, users can select a specific customer, view their account details and transaction history, and transfer money to another customer. Finally, there is a transaction history page that displays all past transactions.

- The website does not have a login page or a user creation feature, and the only function is to transfer money between multiple users.

- To host the website, I chose to use  github.io . I also checked in the code on GitLab, where the repository contains all the details of the website.
